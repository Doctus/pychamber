PyChamber -  by Doctus (kirikayuumura.noir@gmail.com)

	A minimalist, low-distraction text editor based on PyQt.
	
	Designed with portability in mind; should work on almost any platform.
	
	Controls:
		CTRL+N - New Document
		CTRL+O - Open
		CTRL+S - Save
		CTRL+SHIFT+S - Save As
		ESCAPE - Quit
	
	
REQUIREMENTS
	
	Python 2 or Python 3
	PyQt4 or PyQt5
		
		I highly recommend running it with Python 3 for better Unicode support,
		but it's possible to use Python 2 if you're only editing ASCII files.
		
		There should be no significant difference between using PyQt4 or PyQt5,
		but I've only tested Python2+PyQt4 and Python3+PyQt5, so please tell
		me if you notice any problems from the other combinations.
